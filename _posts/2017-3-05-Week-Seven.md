title: Week Seven 
---

This week in Software Engineering, we had our exam. I did manage to study for quite a while, and although the test was difficult, I think I have done fairly well. The format of the test was largely along the lines of 'here is some desired functionality, write a python function that accomplishes it'. I do appreciate that the test did not seem to require miscellaneous 'random' knowledge (ie, trick true or false questions, or complicated multiple choice answers), but the open endedness of the exam does allow for easily missing some points. I feel confident in my responses, but I will have to wait to see my grades.

We are also supposed to be continuing our work on project 3, however I have been caught up with other assignments. I still must find 2 other group members to join my current group of 3, but I will have a lot of time to dedicate to this assignment after this upcoming week finishes.

To finish off the week, we had a guest speaker, Conrad, from MutualMobile talk to the class about professional software design. I had heard of the company MutualMobile before, but I had never actually known what they did. For some reason I pictured them as an Internet service provider. However, they actually act as a 3rd party that helps develop mobile apps for other companies. Conrad spoke on the difficulties of developing apps for an always-changing mobile environment (iOS). The part of the lecture which I enjoyed the most was hearing about the difficulties of designing an app in the midst of the iOS 7 unveiling. iOS 7 was arguably the most dramatic iPhone update, and caused many issues for the developers working at MutalMobile, as Conrad explained.

In the upcoming week, I will begin to make solid progress on assignment 3, as well as hopefully review my exam and figure out what I missed, and what I can improve on.

My tip of the week is this interesting github repo, developed by the engineers at MutualMobile. According to Conrad, this repo (used for creating menus on iPhone apps) is now incredibly widely used by all sorts of iOS devs (not just those from MM). Check it out!
