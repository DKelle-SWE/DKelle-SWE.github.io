title: Week Thirteen

Last week in Software Engineering, we finally completely finialized our database project. In this installment, we finished up the final touches of our search bar, wrote user stories, and utilized the API of newsr.me to incorporate another group's project into our own.

Overall, our website (although not pretty) is fully functional, and can provide all sorts of data about Smash brothers. I think this project was a great way to learn about different types of important tools used in a professional software engineering setting.
Prior to this assignment, we have never had experience with setting up our own integration tests. Being able to set up Travis to automatically run all unit tests with each new push is a great way to slowly and safely integrate new changes. I think this is a great experience to have, especially considering most industry jobs will require unit testing and continuous integration.

Along with finishing up our API, we also finished making a lecture on the python topic 'combinitorics'. Python has a lot of great built in functionality for generating sequences, combiniations, and permutations.
With the itertools package for python, you can call functions such as 'permutations()', 'combinitations()', and 'combinitations_with_replacement()', which can be incredibly helpful for math heavy programs.

For my tip of the week, check out this python documentation that details the inner workings of itertools:

My second, and final tip of the year: Have a great summer!
