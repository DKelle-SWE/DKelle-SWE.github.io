This week in software engineering, we are about to start our 3rd and final iteration of the Database project. In this iteration, we must implement search capabilities. Meaning, on Smashbd.me, a user must be able to search, and get back relevant results for each of our 3 models. Our first model is Player. Player describes the human competitors of each individual tournament. For example, a user might want more information on a player named 'Dallas'. Using our search bar to search for 'Dallas' should yield a link to a Player model object that contains all the information on 'Dallas'. This information includes a Player's name, favorite character (or main), and some tournaments that the player has participated in. Another possibly popular topic of search would be for individual game characters, such as Fox or Luigi. This search would in turn yield an object for an in-game character. This result would contain information such as character name, move set, and how good the character is or, what tier they are. Tiers range from S-F, where S tier is the best (Followed by A, then B, then C, etc). The lowest tier is called F tier, indicating the in-game character is likely not competitively viable. Lastly, a user may want to search for a specific tournament. The resulting Tournament model objects will contain information about the tournaments name, the number of participants, the winners, and more.

Aside from adding search capabilities, we must also continue our work on the wiki. Previously at 3,750 words, we must increase to 5,000 words. This shouldn't be a problem as there should be a lot of detail pertaining to the implementation of the search bar. In order to complete this project, we must also write user stories, which detail an interaction a user may have on our website. And finally, we must also make use of the API of another group.

For this upcoming week in SWE, my group and I must come up with a plan together on how we would like to use another groups API. I'm not sure yet which API we must make use of, but I think this is an interesting addition to the database project, and will encourage me to think more heavily about how other people may be using my future APIs when I am writing them.

Tip of the week:
Happy Easter!
