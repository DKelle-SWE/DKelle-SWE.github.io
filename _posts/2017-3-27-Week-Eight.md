This week in Software Engineering, we started part one of our final project. The final project is to create a fully functioning IMDb like database/website. We were shown an example project called Boilerpl8.me. 
As I said before, it is an IMDb like website that displayed all sorts of data and information about differnet types of recipes, and cuisines, and ingredients. There are some pretty strict guidelines about the libraries we have to use for the webiste.
We chose Super Smash Bros. Melee as our theme. Currently our website is being hosted on AWS under the domain smashdb.me. Our team isn't sold on the domain that we currently have, but we still have time to change it.
Along with hosting our site on AWS, we also have python/Flask responsible for the back end of our website, and routing requests. As per another requirement, AngularJS is being used to help design the front end. 
We have already found a good Bootstrap theme that we all like, and the design of the website is, so far, asthetically pleasing. Mostly what is left is we must implement a database, and dynamically load it full of the data we want to display, using other pre-existing APIs.
We've found three APIs that are going to be useful to us. For the next part of the assignment, we will be focusing on scraping the APIs for revelant data, and loading them into our database. From here, we just need to use AngularJS to query our database, and display real, live data on our webpages.

Next week, my group and I plan on working on setting up the databases that I mentioned earlier. I think the most difficult part about setting up the database will be finding the relevant data, given the APIs we've found seem somewhat unrealiable. 
We will have to get the most out of each one that we possibly can.
