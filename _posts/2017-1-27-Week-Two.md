title: Week Two 
---

This week in Software Engineering, I continued my progress on the Collatz project. The collatz conjecture is itself very simple. If a given number is even, divide it by two. If it is Odd, multiply it by 3, and add 1. Repeat these caclulations until we reach the number one. It is believed that any starting number will eventually yeild a 1, although that is not proven.
I believe the purpose of this project is to teach us about industry development pipeline, because the conjecture itself is very easy to implement. The difficult part of this assignment is integrating with Travis CI, git, unit tests, and acceptance tests. In my opinion, the CI is the most important component to this project.
