1. What did you do this past week?
This week in Software Engineering, I continued my progress on the Collatz project. The main purpose of the project (I feel) is to teach us about the development pipeline in industry. The collatz conjecture is itself very simple. If a given number is even, divide it by two. If it is Odd, multiply it by 3, and add 1. Repeat these caclulations until we reach the number one. It is believed that any starting number will eventually yeild a 1, although that is not proven.
2. What's in your way?

3. What will you do next week?
