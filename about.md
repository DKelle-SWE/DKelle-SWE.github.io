My Name is Dallas Kelle, and I'm a computer science student in my last sememster at the University of Texas at Austin. I've been employed at the university's own research lab, Applied Research Laboratories, National Instruments and Vectra Networks. This summer I'll be working with Intel's processor validation plant in Colorado.
